This project is a practice exercise to explore Google Maps API and geolocation. I compiled a dataset of Turkish universities from Wikipedia and enriched it with coordinates and location details using the API. An interactive map and nearest-university recommendation feature were built in Python. The machine learning part, predicting regions from coordinates, was done entirely using Claude AI. It was all done just for practice, as a hands-on exercise
